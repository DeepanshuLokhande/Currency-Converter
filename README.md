**Currency Converter Project**

This project is a currency converter application built using React.js with Vite, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and an API to fetch the current currency values. It utilizes React's `useState` hook for managing state and a custom hook called `useCurrencyInfo` for fetching currency information from the API. The currency values are fetched from the [@fawazahmed0/currency-api](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@fawazahmed0/currency-api@latest/v1/currencies/"currency".json) API.
